                <p>Good quality data is key to the success of busineses and their operations. Well collected 
                     data have many potentials; they help institutions, especially NGOs and governments to 
                     assess the basis of  their intervensions,  and  it is also vital in  monitoring and evaluation
                      to measure the impact of such intervensions. At BPD2I Consulting, we help orgainisations/governments 
                      to perform data collection as per need  using modern tools such as questionaires, focus groups, 
                      interviews, rapid surveys. Our expert team would readily collect and curate data to meet your
                       business objectives.</p>
